# Space-Recyclers
Space Recyclers was a game created for the CodeWiz Winter Codeathon 2020-2021. This game had to be created in one month, from 12/15/20 to 1/15/21. The idea for this game was to enforce the topic of recycling in a fun and interesting way, which was done by incorporating a space theme. The game's main idea is an astronaut who crash-lands on a deserted planet and then has to locate and recycle scattered boxes and cans. After doing this the astronaut can remake his ship using the recycled materials to leave this planet and return home.
